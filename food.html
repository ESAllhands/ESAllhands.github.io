    We have a fair amount of land and have been slowly working towards getting 100% of our needed produce from our gardens. With this comes many challenges, but
    one challenge in particular is the decision of what to make for meals each week based on what is available in the garden. So, to that end, I have decided to start 
    cataloging our meals (and some recipes) in the hopes that we can eventually have a cookbook, divided by seasons, that we can reference as we choose what to eat. 
    Since our son was just born, the garden was minmized last year, so these meals won't really look that interesting for a while--but eventually it will get edited and organized.
